Here’s a 350-word GitHub project description for your AI-Powered Dashboard - Superstore EDA repository:

📊 AI-Powered Dashboard - Superstore Exploratory Data Analysis
This project presents an interactive data dashboard built with Streamlit, designed to simplify data exploration and visualization of a Superstore Sales dataset. The dashboard is fully AI-assisted, enabling users—technical and non-technical alike—to upload data files, apply dynamic filters, and generate insightful visualizations without writing any code.

The main objective of this dashboard is to provide an easy, no-code way to understand large datasets, with a focus on business intelligence. The application supports file uploads (.csv, .txt, .xlsx), automatically detects and cleans data columns, and ensures all necessary columns are present before proceeding. Users can filter the dataset based on date range, region, state, and city.

The dashboard offers multiple built-in visualizations using Plotly Express:

Bar Chart for product-wise sales

Donut Pie Chart for regional sales

Line Chart to show sales trends over time (monthly/yearly)

Scatter Plot to examine relationships between sales, profit, and units sold

The user interface is sleek and responsive, optimized for wide-screen layouts. Tables are displayed using Pandas Styler with background color gradients for better visual impact. Users can expand/collapse data tables and download CSV files of both the raw and processed datasets directly from the app.

This tool is particularly useful for:

Business analysts looking for fast insights

Data science learners exploring EDA workflows

Teams needing quick decision support dashboards

🔧 Built With
Python

Streamlit – interactive web interface
